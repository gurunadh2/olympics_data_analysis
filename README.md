## Data Sources

### Primary Dataset: `athlete_events.csv`
- **Records**: Individual athlete performances
- **Columns**: Name, Sex, Age, Height, Weight, Team, NOC, Games, Year, Season, City, Sport, Event, Medal
- **Coverage**: Historical Olympic data from 1896 to 2016

### Supporting Dataset: `noc_regions.csv`
- **Purpose**: Maps National Olympic Committee codes to regions
- **Usage**: Geographic analysis and country grouping

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- **Modular Architecture**: Separation of concerns with dedicated files for preprocessing and helper functions
- **Clean Code Structure**: Well-organized functions and logical flow
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and function documentation
- **Error Handling**: Robust data validation and error management

### Areas for Improvement

- **Feature Engineering**: Creates derived columns for analysis
- **Data Transformation**: Prepares data for visualization and analysis

### Helper Functions (`helper.py`)
- **Statistical Calculations**: Medal counts, averages, and aggregations
- **Data Filtering**: Country, sport, and year-based filtering
- **Visualization Helpers**: Data preparation for charts and graphs

### Main Application (`app.py`)
- **User Interface**: Streamlit-based interactive dashboard
- **Navigation**: Multi-page application structure
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic content based on user selections

## Performance Considerations

### Strengths

- **Input Validation**: Streamlit provides built-in input sanitization

## Scalability Analysis

### Current Limitations
- **Dataset Size**: Limited to historical data up to 2016
- **Memory Usage**: In-memory processing may limit scalability
- **Concurrent Users**: Streamlit's inherent limitations for high traffic

### Scalability Solutions
- **Database Integration**: Move to PostgreSQL/MongoDB for larger datasets
- **Caching Layer**: Implement Redis for session management
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple instance deployment for high availability

## Recommendations

### Immediate Improvements
